# dotfiles

My personal dotfiles.

Bash file usage follows convention described in [this StackExchange answer](https://superuser.com/a/789465).

System files:

- `.bash_profile` - loads other files
- `.bashrc` - stuff used for interactive sessions
- `.macos` - macOS-specific stuff

This setup assumes that a separate `.profile` on the individual system with paths and stuff to installed things.

Others:

- `git/` - git global configuration files
- `.condarc` - conda configuration files
